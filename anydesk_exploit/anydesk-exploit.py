# Title : AnyDesk 3.6.0 - Local Privilege Escalation with DLL hijacking
# Date : 26/05/2020
# Forked from : 0x09AL (https://twitter.com/0x09AL)
# CVE : CVE-2017-14397
# Tested on: AnyDesk 3.6.0 - Windows 7 32bit
# Vendor : https://www.anydesk.com/
# Vulnerability Description:
# When AnyDesk is installed a service named AnyDesk is installed also and runs as Local System.
# In the code there is a call to LoadLibrary("win_app.dll") which causes this problem.
# By default when LoadLibrary isn't called with full path Windows will search the actual directory and then the ones that are in the PATH environment. 
# To Exploit this vulnerability when need to put a DLL payload in a writable PATH directory.
# Generate a DLL Payload and name it payload.dll.
# The exploit below will try to find the PATH env folders that are writable and will drop the payload.dll there.
# When the service is restarted or when the computer starts up the payload will execute with the highest privilege.
#
# I would like to thank the AnyDesk team (Olaf Liebe,Andreas Mahler) for the pleasant responsible disclosure experience.
#
# Before launch it, you must install all requirements using:
# 	->	pip install -r requirements.txt
